           Fox was no ordinary fox; he was the little red stubborn fox,
            who relived that story, time and time again. 
            And though he implied the grape might be sour, 
            deep down he knew that this shiny tempting grape 
            was one of the most magnificent fruits he had ever seen. 
            The tale does not end here for the desire to exploit further 
            and to reach the ultimate sophistication of the finding burned 
            within him. And with overcoming obstacles comes a guaranteed 
            satisfaction nested behind a hidden door, waiting to be discovered. 
            It is not just any vine, any vineyard or any wine, you have to be up 
            for it, to earn it and to deserve it. The little fox did.
            Experience the unique aromas where the unreachable becomes the richest, 
            and the unthinkable a reality. 
            Explore an enigma that intrigues the imagination, 
            and leads you to uncover a secret underneath the unrevealed identity of 
            our story and our wine. This discovery is accessible only to the ones who 
            can decrypt the code of redefined taste. Fox overcame the challenge, now it's your turn…
